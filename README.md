# SSQL - Suckless Structured Query Language

A preprocessor that turns SQL into something sane and joyful to use.

## What it is

A strict superset of standard SQL with a cleaner surface. It adds useful 
conveniences and removes friction, making queries faster to write and easier to 
read. SSQL source is transpiled into standard SQL for multiple backends, 
including PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and others.
